# Capsule Monsters

**Capsule Monsters** was the initial proposal Game Freak made for a monster catching game, which was then renamed to the world-wide famous Pocket Monsters, Pokémon.

This is a custom game based on [the Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokered). It aims to create a new experience using the earliest assets available.

Keep in mind that it's supposed to be a simpler RPG, simpler than even the very first Pokémon games. It takes inspiration from early RPGs, such as Dragon Quest/Warrior, Final Fantasy Legend, etc.
